  <h2>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀What is Physics</h2>
  <p>Physics is the scientific study of matter, energy, and the interactions between them. It seeks to understand and explain the fundamental principles governing the behavior of the physical world. Physicists study a wide range of phenomena, from the smallest subatomic particles to the vast expanse of the universe. They use mathematical models, experimentation, and observation to formulate theories and make predictions about how the physical world works. Physics plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of the natural world and has many practical applications in fields such as engineering, technology, and medicine.</p>
